maybe try 32 bits
feed the input into an array of 32 bits, pass this one into the function, and then


ok, so we tried to face the problem of overflowing the stack by taking the transfer in segments. However, it doesn't work because it just takes separate pics.
always only get the top segment of the pic if you do less. Need to just adjust stack size I'd say


Make sure u understand which ones correspond to stack and whatnot
