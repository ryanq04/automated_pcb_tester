University of Toronto ECE342 Embedded Systems Course
Ryan Qi, Avani Yadav


We have created an automated PCB tester prototype similar to the ICT devices or Flying probe testers that are used to verify PCBs on a production line. 
This project was created in roughly 80 hours for the final project of ECE342 and uses the STM32F446ZE, ov7670 camera, NEMA17 stepper, SG90 Servos, PCA9685 servo driver, and L298N stepper driver. 

Communication is over UART, program is written in C for the STM32, and Python for the user interface on the PC.
